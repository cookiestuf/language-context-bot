<h1 align="center">Language Context Bot</h1>

Meet your new language learning bot! 

## Purpose
There are roughly 6,500 languages spoken in the world today. Learning another language allows one to learn about another culture and hear new perspectives. Plus, research shows that bilingualism correlates with increased cognitive development and abilities.

This Twitter bot helps users learn another language by sending a word of the day in any of the 13 available languages with a link to the word used in context in either an article, video, or song.

Learn about current events in another county! Discover your new favorite Youtube channel! Sing a song in another language!

## Features (all under development)
- Easy subscription and unsubscription through Twitter Tweets
- Sends users Tweets with the word and a link to the word in context twice a week
- Customized content based on subscriptor's preferences
- 13 languages available to subscribe to
- The news sources and video channels shared by the bot are all sourced from native speakers

## Notes
This project is a _work-in-progress_ and built using Flask and Twitter and hosted on Heroku.
